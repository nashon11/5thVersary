      <p>Five months. It might seem like a short span in the grand scheme of things, but to me, it’s been a lifetime of moments that shaped us, molded us, tested us, and brought us closer than I ever thought possible. From that very first moment, something felt different about you — like finding a piece of myself I didn’t realize I was missing until it was right in front of me.</p>

      <div class="divider">~ ~ ♡ ~ ~ ♡ ~ ~ ♡ ~ ~ ♡ ~ ~</div>

      <p>These five months have been ours — ours to stumble through, ours to learn from, ours to laugh, cry, and grow through. We’ve felt the warmth of quiet nights where words weren’t needed, and the sting of moments when silence felt too long. We’ve had moments where we disagreed, moments where we felt misunderstood, moments where loving felt like a risk… and yet, every single time, we came back to this one simple truth: that what we have is worth holding onto, worth choosing every day.</p>

      <p>Through every low, every misstep, every challenge, every conversation that felt too hard — I watched you show up. I watched you rise. And I watched us rise together. Not because it was easy, but because this is worth it. You’re worth it. We’re worth it.</p>
      <p>Five months of knowing you has taught me more about love, about patience, about trust, and about myself than I ever imagined. You’ve shown me what it means to stay, to be present, to fight for ‘us’ even when it’s hard. And for that, for every moment, every conversation, every laugh and every lesson, I’m grateful beyond words.</p>

      <div class="divider">~ ~ ♡ ~ ~ ♡ ~ ~ ♡ ~ ~ ♡ ~ ~</div>

      <p>Today, I just want you to know this: I don’t measure ‘us’ by days or months. I measure ‘us’ by moments. By the warmth I feel when you walk into a room. By the peace I find when you’re in my arms. By the fact that no matter how hard a day is, knowing I get to come back to you makes it bearable. You’re not just my person… you’re home.</p>

      <p style="text-align: right; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 30px;">So here’s to five months, my love. Five months of choosing each other. Five months of putting in the work, sharing the tears, and finding moments of joy that only we can create. Whatever tomorrow brings, I’m grateful for this chapter we’re writing together — a chapter that reminds me every day that some stories are worth holding onto.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 10px;">Happy five months, baby. I love you, I’m proud of you, and I’m so grateful for the person you are and the heart you give. Whatever comes next, I’m right here. Always. ❤️</p>
